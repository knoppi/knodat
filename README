This is my suite of python tools for:
- mainly evaluation of scientific data
- all the helping tools I used within this context, like reading directory content
  and putting it into a readable format, as well as parsing filename according 
  to a given scheme#

In order to be able to use the tools, your system needs to fulfill the following requirements
- Python should be installed, I'm currently running several version, 2.6.6 works fine, 
  no 3.0 version has been tested so far
- Many tools use Numpy and Scipy for mathematical routines or data evaluation
- For plotting Matplotlib is used

Usage instructions:
- Install the package into a folder which is contained within you PYTHONPATH
  environment variable, then everything should be fine
- Within knodat/evtools there are scripts which can be used directly from the
  command line. They require the last step and it is recommended to put
  their location into your PATH variable
