Feature to implemented in the future
    - write unit tests
    - unit tests as a sort of example?
    - document evtools

Other todo:
    - delete deprecated methods
    - uniform structure in function / method headers
    - strange collection of getitem methods -> clean and define deprecated methods
    - conformity with PEP-XXX
    - what to do with debug output?
